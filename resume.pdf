# Resume PDF Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file. In a real implementation, this would be an actual PDF document containing:

- Personal Information
- Professional Summary
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Certifications
- Contact Information

The file should be named `resume.pdf` and placed in the root directory of the portfolio.

For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors when users click the resume download button.
